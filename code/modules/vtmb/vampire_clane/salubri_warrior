Contrary to their other half of the clan, the Salubri Antitribu are the remnants of the clan's Warrior caste, and have by and large cast their lot in with the Sabbat in hopes of taking revenge on the Tremere. Consequently, the average Antitribu would have been embraced recently, conscripted during a time when tensions between Camarilla and Sabbat were at their highest - and trained to deliver retribution upon the Usurpers."
